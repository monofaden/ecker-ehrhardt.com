              I am a Senior Researcher at Goethe University Frankfurt, where my research focuses on international
              organizations’ digital communication, its adaptation to far-right contestation, and patterns of user
              engagement with IO messaging—including engagement by far-right sceptics of international organizations.
              This work is part of the
              <a href="https://farrio.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FARRIO project</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              My research has been published in leading international journals, including
              <em>International Organization</em>, <em>International Studies Quarterly</em>,
              <em>Review of International Organizations</em>, <em>Global Studies Quarterly</em>, and
              <em>European Journal of International Relations</em>.

        <p>
          I studied political science at Freie Universität Berlin, where I received my doctorate in 2003.
          My dissertation, <em>Argument, Coalitions, Cognitions: The German Debate on the Eastward Expansion of the EU</em>,
          was graded <em>summa cum laude</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          From 2005 to 2013, I worked as a Senior Researcher in the <em>Transnational Conflicts and International Institutions</em>
          department at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB). Between 2014 and 2017, I led the DFG-funded project
          <em>The Communicated IO: Public Relations, Inclusion of Civil Society Actors and the Global Politicisation of
          International Organisations</em> at the Centre for Transnational Relations, Foreign and Security Policy at
          Freie Universität Berlin.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2020–21, I was a Senior Fellow at the Käte Hamburger Kolleg, Centre for Global Cooperation Research at the
          University of Duisburg–Essen, where I subsequently led the BMBF-funded project
          <em>(De)Legitimation Surveys: Political Ideology, Peer Opinion, Nonstate Actor Inclusion, and the Social Legitimacy
          of Global Governance Institutions</em> from 2021 to 2024.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have held temporary professorships in International Relations at Freie Universität Berlin, the University of Leipzig,
          the University of Bamberg, and most recently at Goethe University Frankfurt.
