    <p>
      I am a Senior Researcher at Goethe University Frankfurt, where my research
      focuses on international organizations’ digital communication, its
      adaptation to far-right contestation, and patterns of user engagement with
      IO messaging—including engagement by far-right sceptics of international
      organizations. This work is part of the
      <a href="https://farrio.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        FARRIO project
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My research has been published in leading international journals, including
      <em>International Organization</em>, <em>International Studies Quarterly</em>,
      <em>Review of International Organizations</em>,
      <em>Global Studies Quarterly</em>, and
      <em>European Journal of International Relations</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I studied political science at Freie Universität Berlin, where I received
      my doctorate in 2003. My dissertation,
      <em>Argument, Coalitions, Cognitions: The German Debate on the Eastward Expansion of the EU</em>,
      was graded <em>summa cum laude</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From 2005 to 2013, I worked as a Senior Researcher in the
      <em>Transnational Conflicts and International Institutions</em> department
      at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB). Between 2014 and 2017, I led the
      DFG-funded project <em>The Communicated IO: Public Relations, Inclusion of
      Civil Society Actors and the Global Politicisation of International
      Organisations</em> at the Centre for Transnational Relations, Foreign and
      Security Policy at Freie Universität Berlin.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2020–21, I was a Senior Fellow at the Käte Hamburger Kolleg, Centre for
      Global Cooperation Research at the University of Duisburg–Essen, where I
      subsequently led the BMBF-funded project
      <em>(De)Legitimation Surveys: Political Ideology, Peer Opinion, Nonstate
      Actor Inclusion, and the Social Legitimacy of Global Governance
      Institutions</em> from 2021 to 2024.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have held temporary professorships in international relations at Freie
      Universität Berlin, the University of Leipzig, the University of Bamberg,
      and most recently at Goethe University Frankfurt.
