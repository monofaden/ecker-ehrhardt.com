          This project examines what international organizations (IOs) are publicly “recognized for” by their main
          constituents—states—over nearly eight decades. Using a comprehensive content analysis of UN General Debate
          speeches (1946–2024), we trace how governments attribute policy functions and authority to different components
          of IOs (e.g., intergovernmental bodies, expert groups, secretariats) and how patterns of deference, appraisal,
          critique, and defiance evolve over time. We combine manual and automated text analysis to map long-run shifts
          in the public standing of rule-based governance, and we test whether changes are systematically associated with
          ideological shifts in domestic politics while accounting for alternative explanations such as institutional
          proliferation and changing power differentials.

          Far-right parties are increasingly represented in democratic governments worldwide, with potentially important
          consequences for multilateral diplomacy inside international organizations. This project studies how far-right
          government participation affects delegation politics at UNFCCC Conferences of the Parties (COPs)—a central arena
          where states negotiate agendas, policies, budgets, and institutional reforms. Drawing on original data on more
          than 100,000 COP participants (1995–2024), we analyze whether the long-observed shift toward more technocratic,
          expertise-oriented global governance is reflected in delegation size, portfolio composition, and personal
          continuity—and whether, and how strongly, far-right incumbency alters these trends.

        <h2>Engaging the Enemy? IO Social-Media Communication, National-Populist Contestation, and Public Resonance</h2>
        <p>
          Social media has become a key arena for nationalist-populist contestation of “liberal” international
          organizations. Focusing on Twitter/X communication surrounding the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular
          Migration (GCM), this project analyzes whether and how IO digital communication adapts in the face of intense,
          ideologically charged opposition online—and whether such adaptation improves public resonance. Using qualitative
          and quantitative content analysis, we show that UN messaging remained highly selective and largely “stayed on
          message” (emphasizing migrant protection, the broader benefits of migration, and the value of global migration
          governance), while also increasingly countering critics by framing claims as myths lacking facts. More nuanced
          shifts include greater references to host-society benefits and national sovereignty. However, engagement patterns
          suggest that accommodation remained limited: strategies that grew more prominent tended to reduce the share of
          critical audiences interacting with UN tweets.

        <h2>WHO Authority and Resonance in Social Media Communication</h2>
        <p class="muted">

          <a href="https://colfa.utsa.edu/faculty/profiles/hofferberth-matthias.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthias Hofferberth</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          International organizations have rapidly expanded their use of social media to communicate with diverse
          constituencies, yet we still know little about what makes such communication effective—or how it relates to
          public recognition of IO authority. This project examines the public resonance of the World Health
          Organization’s social-media communication and theorizes “affirmative resonance” as one pathway through which
          the WHO can bolster its role as a global health governor. We focus on three mechanisms: (a) authoritative calls
          for action and evaluations of public-health performance, (b) personalization through WHO officials alongside
          institutional accounts, and (c) socio-technical affordances such as visuals and hashtag activism. Using a large-N
          analysis of COVID-19-related WHO posts and retweet counts, we find that authoritative claims, personalization,
          visuals, and hashtags each increase affirmative resonance on average. Importantly, visuals condition the effect
          of personalization when authority is claimed, consistent with the idea that perceived authenticity shapes how
          personalized authority is received online.
